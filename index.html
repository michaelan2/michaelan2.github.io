        <h2> Bruinwalk Redesign </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://https://bruinwalk.com/"> Bruinwalk </a> is UCLA's most beloved student review site, for anything from classes to apartments in Westwood. I'm working with an incredible team of student designers and developers on a site-wide redesign task to modernize our user experience. </p>

        <h2> Stress Tracking through Touchpad Usage </h2>
        <p> At Stanford's Pervasive Wellbeing Technology Lab, we were developing scalable, non-invasive methods for longitudinal health tracking. My project last summer built a novel method for tracking stress levels in laptop users through their touchpad strokes. By treating the user's motions as damped oscillations, we could extrapolate muscle tension in the arm and thus indirectly measure stress. <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e22743/"> See our publication! </a></p>

        <h2> UCLA CS145 (Data Mining): COVID Modeling </h2>
        <p> My friends and I took part in a class-wide Kaggle competition to model the spread of COVID across the US and predict the trajectories of total infections and deaths. We explored RNNs, autoregressive models, and <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model">differential equations</a> (pictured to the left) but found these state of the art approaches to perform poorly since the training <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"> data</a> was highly noisy (due to frequent gaps and recounts in infection data). Unfortunately due to our lack of expertise in cleaning data and in tuning the more complex models, we received wildly off validation results for these state of the art approaches and we ended up submitting our most resilient model to this noise: one of our linear baselines. Funnily enough, we placed around the 50th percentile in the competition. </p>

      <h2> ECE147: Deep Neural Networks </h2>
      <p> Implemented a FBSCP-inspired shallow CNN for EEG classification. This shallow net didn't only beat our deeper models, but also beat the previous class record for highest accuracy! It turns out that a little domain knowledge goes a lot further than ML expertise. </p>

      <h2> CS145: Data Mining </h2>
      <p> In a project to build a predictor for number of active COVID cases in the US, we found that despite our best attempts at preprocessing, the data was so dirty that our baseline per-state linear fitting outperformed more sophisticated epidemiological models like SIR and our neural nets. </p>
